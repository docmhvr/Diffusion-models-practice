# Stable Diffusion Model Applications

Welcome to the repository for Stable Diffusion Model Applications. This repository demonstrates various applications of the stable diffusion models for generating and transforming images and audio.

### 1. Text-to-Image Generation
Generate images from textual descriptions using the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model.

### 2. Image-to-Image Transformation
Transform existing images into new ones using the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model.

### 3. Image In-Painting
Perform in-painting on images using the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting` model.

### 4. Deterministic Image Generation
Generate deterministic images using the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model.

### 5. Audio Generation
Generate audio from text using the `cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2` model.

##### Special thanks to the authors and contributors of the runwayml and cvssp models for their valuable work.
